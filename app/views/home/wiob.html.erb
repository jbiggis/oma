				<h3>THE BOX</h3>

				Each month members receive 5-6 food samples that we’ve tasted and eaten ourselves ranging from snacks, condiments, spices, candies, prepared food, sauces, etc. They can be made by well-known brands to emerging or established artisanal producers.

				<h3>THE COMMUNITY</h3>

				We’re creating a community of food tasters that search for the coolest, tastiest, and unique new food nds. Once found, the community shares it with us through social media, and we deliver these tasty nds in our next monthly Omakase box to the rest of the community.

				<h3>HELPING THOSE IN NEED</h3>
				Hunger is hidden problem in Canada and many don’t know that there are a large number of children and families that often go hungry before bed. We’d like to do our part. So with every Omakase box that's delivered, we donate part of our proceeds to Food Banks Canada.
