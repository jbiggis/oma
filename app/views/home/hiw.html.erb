			<h3>Search</h3>
			
			<p>We're always on the lookout for tasty foods, and with the help of our commu-
			nity of food lovers, we search out the next tasty treat to feature in our monthly
			Omakase box. When we've found something delicious, we'll contact the pro-
			ducer so that we can share the nd with the rest of our community in the next
			delivery of the Omakase box.</p>

			<h3>Deliver</h3>


			<p>Each month members receive a tasty Omakase box lled with 5-6 food samples
			from our community-driven search. Every box also contains detailed informa-
			tion regarding each product, everything from who made it, how it was made,
			where it came from, and how you can use it. Imagine the anticipation you'll get
			with each delivery!</p>

			<h3>Share</h3>


			<p>We share all our cool nds with our web savvy community by using social
			media tools such as Facebook and Twitter. And they’ll do the same, letting us
			know what they enjoyed in their Omakase box, their own tasty nds, and even
			suggesting things we can feature in next month’s delivery.</p>

			<h3>Philanthropy</h3>

			<p>With every Omakase box that's delivered, we donate part of our proceeds to
			Food Banks Canada. As socially conscious foodies, we'll lend a helping hand to
			those less privileged. Hunger is hidden problem in Canada and many don’t
			know that there are a large number of children and families that often go
			hungry before bed. And with the number of people being assisted by a food
			bank on the rise, the urgency has never been greater for those most vulnerable.
			We’d like to do our part, and together, you can still have your cake and share it
			too.</p>

			<p class='orange'>We sort through the clutter to send members what’s good so that they can get it themselves. It’s a fun game everyone can share, with a rewarding treat in the end!”</p>
